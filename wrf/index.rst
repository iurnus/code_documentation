Install and test WRF
####################

The WRF ARW model is a fully compressible, nonhydrostatic model (with a
hydrostatic option). The WRF ARW model contains initialization programs
(``ideal.exe`` and ``real.exe``), a numerical integration program
(``wrf.exe``), and a program to do one-way nesting (``ndown.exe``). The WRF
supports a variety of capabilities, including:

* Real-data and idealized simulations
* Various lateral boundary condition options for both real-data and idealized simulations
* Full physics options
* Non-hydrostatic and hydrostatic (as runtime options)
* One-way, two-way nesting and a moving nest
* Applications ranging from meters to thousands of kilometers
